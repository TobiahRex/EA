### Plan
  * Create a backlog of testing data.  10 years of PSAR settings at .0009 x .2 for 1hr.
    - 30m & 1hr chart
      * GBPNZD
      * EURNZD
      * GBPJPy
  * 10 years of PSAR settings at .009 x .2 for 1m.
    - 30m & 1hr chart

  * The idea is to calculate current market speed.  NOT average speed.  
  Current market speed should be taken from taking the limit of change between 1hr all the way down to 1m.
  The speed will then be cross referenced back to the database of price tests we've conducted.
  We'll find the most optimal settings for our indicators based on those 10 years of data.
  Then adjust the settings accordingly.

  * The Stoploss
    - 1) Take a profit amount for each trade. Something small.  Think semi-high frequency.
    - 2) Evaluate best stop loss on historical price action speeds.
      * Example: "If PSAR is .009 @ .2 and the market speed is +15 pips/1m then the highest probability of success is having a 10 pip stop loss & profit target should be 13 pips.".
